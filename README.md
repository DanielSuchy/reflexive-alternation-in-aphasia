# reflexive-alternation-in-aphasia
This repository contains the data related to my thesis on reflexive alternation in language processing by persons with aphasia.

The goal of this thesis is to research how frequency of use and grammatical structure affect sentence comprehension in healthy speakers and speakers with aphasia.
This repository contains the corpus data, experiment stimuli and experiment results.
It also contains the scripts that I used to extract and analyse the data and the results.
